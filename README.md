# Minecraft Auto Commands
## A PYQT5 GUI app that allows the user to set a hot key and a desired command for Minecraft.

## This app will only run successfully if the MinecraftLauncher.exe is running.
## Upon successful start up and you activate a hot key the app will first press the letter 't' to start the command line in game and execute the set command and if checked the enter key will be pressed automatically.
